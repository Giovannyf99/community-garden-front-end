            <h2>American Food Insecurity</h2>
            <p className="AbFoodIns">
                Food deserts are long-established challenges, but current events are deepening the hunger. The lingering effects of the pandemic, inflation, and war-induced supply chain disruptions are weakening American food security. According to a poll conducted by Bayer in the summer of 2022, 51% of Americans say they buy less healthy food than they used to, due to rising cost. Currently about 87% of Americans say they are extremely or moderately concerned about the rising prices of groceries.

            <h2>Food Deserts</h2>
                <p className="AbFoodDsrt">
                There are over 6,500 food deserts in the U.S. These are places where economics and geography make it harder for people to access healthy, nutritious food. While the challenges for those in rural and urban food deserts may look different, their refrigerators often look the same.

                <h2>Benefits of a Community Garden</h2>
                <p className="ABBenGarden">
                Community gardens can mitigate some of the problems that plague urban areas. They can be a beneficial addition to many communities by increasing the availability of nutritious foods, strengthening community ties, reducing environmental hazards, reducing food miles, and creating a more sustainable system
